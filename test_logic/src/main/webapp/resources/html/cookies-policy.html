                                                                                       data-lineheight="34">Website
                Function Cookies</h4><h4 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="34">Our own cookies</h4>
            <p>We use cookies to make our website work including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remembering your search settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.</p><h4
                    data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="34">Third party functions</h4>
            <p>Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an
                embedded YouTube video. Our site includes the following which use cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google – <a href="http://cookie.attacat.co.uk/policy_plain.php">Privacy Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties</p><h4
                    data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="34">Social Website Cookies</h4>
            <p>So you can easily “Like” or share our content on the likes of Facebook and Twitter we have included
                sharing buttons on our site.</p>
            <p>The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on
                the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.</p><h4 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="34">
                Anonymous Visitor Statistics Cookies</h4>
            <p>We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type
                of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as
                it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc.
                This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called “analytics” programs also tell us if,
                on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have
                been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing
                spend.</p><h4 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="34">Turning Cookies Off</h4>

            <p>You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies
                (Learn how <a href="http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-ban">here</a>). Doing so, however,
                will likely limit the functionality of our’s and a large proportion of the world’s websites as cookies
                are a standard part of most modern websites</p>

            <!--<p>It may be that you concerns around cookies relate to so called “spyware”. Rather than switching off-->
                <!--cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by-->
